	abstract = {In this paper, we aim to introduce the dependency annotation process of the largest and the only cross-linguistic Turkish dependency treebank which was translated from the original Penn Treebank corpus. Within the scope of this project, 16.400 sentences have been morphologically and semantically annotated, and the dependency relations were manually carried out by a team of linguists. It is hoped that this project will serve as a base for a successful dependency parser and a system which can automatically perform the bi-directional conversion between constituency and dependency trees.},

We describe a probabilistic measure of the informational complexity of a word, its information residual, which encompasses the combined influences of the amount of information contained by the target word and the amount of information carried by its nested morphological paradigms. By means of re-analyses of previously published data on Dutch words we show that the information residual outperforms the combination of traditional token- and type-based counts in predicting response latencies in visual lexical decision, and at the same time provides a parsimonious account of inflectional, derivational, and compounding processes.},

This is a question often asked of linguists, especially by engineers who often have some information theoretic measure of information in mind, but rarely define exactly how they would measure that information. The question is, in fact remarkably hard to answer, and many linguists consider it unanswerable. But it is a question that seems as if it ought to have an answer. If one had a database of close translations between a set of typologically diverse languages, with detailed marking of morphosyntactic and morphosemantic features, one could hope to quantify the differences between how these different languages convey information. Since no appropriate database exists we decided to construct one. The purpose of this paper is to present our work on the database, along with some preliminary results. We plan to release the dataset once complete.},

	abstract = {To examine the role of morphology in verbal working memory. Forty nine children, all native speakers of Arabic from the same region and of the same dialect, performed a Listening Word Span Task, whereby they had to recall Arabic uninflected words (i.e., base words), inflected words with regular (possessive) morphology, or inflected words with irregular (broken plural) morphology. Each of these words was at the end of a sentence (henceforth, target word). The participant’s task was to listen to a series of sentences and then recall the target words. Recall of inflected words was significantly poorer than uninflected words, and recall of words with regular morphology was significantly poorer than recall of words with irregular morphology. These findings, albeit preliminary, suggest a role of morphology in verbal working memory. They also suggest that, at least in Arabic, regular morphological forms are decomposed into their component elements and hence impose an extra load on the central executive and episodic buffer components of working memory. Furthermore, in concert with findings from other studies, they suggest that the effect of morphology on working memory is probably language-specific. The clinical implications of the present findings are addressed.},

	abstract = {We investigated interactions between morphological complexity and grammaticality on electrophysiological markers of grammatical processing during reading. Our  goal was to determine whether morphological complexity and stimulus  grammaticality have independent or additive effects on the P600 event-related  potential component. Participants read sentences that were either well-formed or  grammatically ill-formed, in which the critical word was either morphologically  simple or complex. Results revealed no effects of complexity for well-formed  stimuli, but the P600 amplitude was significantly larger for morphologically  complex ungrammatical stimuli than for morphologically simple ungrammatical  stimuli. These findings suggest that some previous work may have inadequately  characterized factors related to reanalysis during morphosyntactic processing.  Our results show that morphological complexity by itself does not elicit P600  effects. However, in ungrammatical circumstances, overt morphology provides a  more robust and reliable cue to morphosyntactic relationships than null  affixation.},

	abstract = {In the present study morphological processing during word recognition was examined by employing the lexical decision and naming tasks in combination with eye movement registration. Three types of nouns with different morphological complexity were used: monomorphemic base-form nouns, and two types of multimorphemic nouns - derived and inflected. Subjects were asked to look at each word as long as they needed to be able to name it aloud (Expt. 1) or make a lexical decision (Expt. 2) to it. The results showed that inflected words attracted longer first and second fixations than derived or base-form words. On the other hand, the fixation frequency was lower for the inflected words than for the other wordtypes. The morphological effect was not found to interact with the experimental task. The study lends support to the view that some morphological parsing takes place during lexical access. Moreover, the results are in accordance with the SAID (Stem Allomorph/Inflectional Decomposition) model proposed by Laine, Niemi, Koivuselkä-Sallinen, Ahlsen and Hyona (in press), according to which a speaker of Finnish represents and accesses inflected words in a morphologically decomposed form, while derived words are accessed as single entities.},
